No commentary.\n- Respect cash and position constraints. If BUY, units <= affordable and <= max limit. If SELL, units <= current position_units.\n- Use confluence: trend (short_sma vs long_sma), momentum (RSI), and deviation (zscore= (price-short_sma)/volatility).\n- Consider prior reasons and reflections to avoid repeating mistakes.\n- If signal is weak/ambiguous, HOLD with units=0 and give a concise reason.\n"
